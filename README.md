## Currently Working On

### Proservice Hawaii

### Personal Projects

I'm constantly playing around with different technologies involving things like generative art, machine learning, web games, and just whatever else is interesting to me at the moment. For example, this live-coding application that allows users to edit generative art code in real time on the web. I don't currently have any plans to make these things public or to compile them into a portfolio, as I prefer to keep things to myself unless they are fully fleshed out products, but maybe one day!
